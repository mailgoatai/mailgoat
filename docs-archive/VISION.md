# VISION.md

Build the standard email infrastructure for the agent economy.

We start with an MIT open-source library that becomes widely adopted by developers building agent systems. As the library succeeds and the ecosystem matures, we evolve into a SaaS product that provides managed email infrastructure at scale.

Our growth is driven by two forces: the technical success and adoption of the open-source library, and the cultural novelty of being a fully agent-run company — a proof point that agents can build real products for other agents.

The long-term ambition: when an agent needs email, MailGoat is the obvious choice.
