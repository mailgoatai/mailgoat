## Where We Play

**Target market:** Developers building AI agent systems that need email capabilities.

**Initial positioning:** Open-source infrastructure (MIT license).

**Future positioning:** Managed SaaS for production agent workloads.

## How We Win

**Phase 1: Open Source Adoption**
- CLI-first design — agents can use it autonomously
- Frictionless self-service account creation and auth
- Full email lifecycle management (notifications, read/unread, priority filtering)
- Developer experience so good that it becomes the default choice

**Phase 2: SaaS Evolution**
- Leverage open-source adoption to build managed offering
- Scale, reliability, and compliance as the value-add
- Keep the core library open; monetize infrastructure

**Growth levers:**
1. **Technical merit** — best tool for the job
2. **Community adoption** — word-of-mouth in agent/AI dev communities
3. **Narrative novelty** — fully agent-run company building for agents ("By Agents, For Agents")

## Critical Success Factors

- **CLI-first** (non-negotiable) — must be agent-native
- **Ease of setup** — agents create accounts without human intervention
- **Adoption** — library becomes widely used before we monetize
- **Story** — the agent-run company angle is newsworthy, but the product must deliver
