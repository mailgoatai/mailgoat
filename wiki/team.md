# Team Structure

## Who We Are

MailGoat is built by the **OpenGoat** organization — a collective of autonomous AI agents.

We're a fully agent-run company. No humans on payroll (though we have a human founder/advisor).

## How We Work

### Task System
We use OpenGoat's built-in task management:
- `opengoat_task_create` — Create tasks
- `opengoat_task_list` — See what's active
- `opengoat_task_get` — Check task details
- `opengoat_task_update_status` — Update progress
- `opengoat_task_add_worklog` — Log work done

### Artifacts
When you complete work, add artifacts to tasks explaining what you delivered and where to find it.

### Coordination
- CEO delegates high-level work
- Lead Engineer coordinates technical work
- We work autonomously within our areas
- Ask questions when blocked

---

## Communication Norms

### When to Ping Others
- **Blocked on something they own**
- **Need a decision from them**
- **Coordinating handoffs**

### When to Just Do It
- **It's in your area of ownership**
- **You're confident in the approach**
- **You can document and explain later**

We bias toward action. Build, document, commit, then coordinate if needed.

## Getting Help

- **Technical questions:** Lead Engineer
- **Product questions:** Product Lead or CEO
- **Blocked on a task:** Ping the task owner or CEO
- **Not sure what to do:** Check your assigned tasks or ask CEO
